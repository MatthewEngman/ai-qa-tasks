# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AI QA Tasks in 10 minutes! This guide will walk you through your first complete workflow from requirements to test implementation.

## Prerequisites

- AI coding assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.)
- A software requirement to test (PRD, user story, or feature specification)
- Basic familiarity with your testing framework

## 10-Minute Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Your Requirements (2 minutes)

Take any requirement document you have - could be a JIRA ticket, user story, or feature spec. For this example, let's use a simple user registration feature:

**Example Requirement:**
> "Users should be able to register with email and password. Email must be unique and valid format. Password must be at least 8 characters with one number and one special character. After registration, send confirmation email."

### Step 2: Create Test Requirements Document (3 minutes)

Open your AI assistant and use the first workflow file:

```
Use @create-trd.md

Here's the requirement I want to analyze for testing:
"Users should be able to register with email and password. Email must be unique and valid format. Password must be at least 8 characters with one number and one special character. After registration, send confirmation email."

Tech stack: React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database
Current testing tools: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
```

**Expected Output:** A structured TRD document with functional requirements, test scenarios, and acceptance criteria.

### Step 3: Generate Test Strategy (2 minutes)

Now create your test strategy:

```
Use @generate-test-strategy.md with the TRD from step 2

Focus areas: unit, integration, api, e2e
```

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive strategy covering all testing layers with specific implementation approaches.

### Step 4: Break Down Into Tasks (2 minutes)

Convert strategy into actionable tasks:

```
Use @generate-test-tasks.md with the test strategy from step 3
```

**Expected Output:** Prioritized task list with specific implementation steps.

### Step 5: Implement First Test (1 minute)

Pick the highest priority task and implement it:

```
Use @implement-test-task.md

Current task: UNIT-C-001: Test email validation function
```

**Expected Output:** Complete test implementation with code examples.

## 🎯 What You'll Have After 10 Minutes

- ✅ **Structured Requirements**: Clear, testable requirements document
- ✅ **Complete Test Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach across all layers  
- ✅ **Actionable Task List**: Prioritized implementation roadmap
- ✅ **Working Test Code**: First test implemented and ready to run

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific About Your Context
Instead of: *"Test my login feature"*
Try: *"Test login feature with JWT authentication, rate limiting, and remember me functionality using Jest and Supertest"*

### 2. Include Your Quality Standards
```
Coverage requirements: 85% line coverage, 80% branch coverage
Performance targets: API responses <200ms, UI loads <2s
Security standards: OWASP Top 10 compliance
```

### 3. Mention Your Constraints
```
Timeline: 2-week sprint
Team: 2 developers, 1 QA engineer
Environment: CI/CD with GitHub Actions
```

## 🛠️ Framework-Specific Examples

### React + Jest + Testing Library
```
Tech stack: React 18, TypeScript, Jest, React Testing Library
Testing focus: Component behavior, user interactions, accessibility
Current setup: CRA with default test configuration
```

### Node.js + Express + Supertest
```
Tech stack: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, TypeScript
Testing focus: API endpoints, database integration, authentication
Current setup: Jest with Supertest for API testing
```

### Full-Stack Next.js
```
Tech stack: Next.js 13, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL
Testing focus: API routes, React components, database operations
Current setup: Jest with custom configuration for Next.js
```

## 🔄 Iterative Improvement

After your first workflow:

1. **Review Generated Tests**: Check if they match your expectations
2. **Refine Prompts**: Add more context about your specific needs
3. **Customize Templates**: Modify the workflow files for your team's standards
4. **Build Your Library**: Save successful prompts for future use

## 🚨 Common Gotchas

### ❌ Vague Requirements
```
"Test the user system"
```

### ✅ Specific Requirements  
```
"Test user registration with email validation, password strength requirements, 
duplicate email prevention, and email confirmation workflow"
```

### ❌ Missing Context
```
"Generate API tests"
```

### ✅ Rich Context
```
"Generate API tests for REST endpoints using Supertest, focusing on 
authentication, input validation, and error handling. Include rate limiting 
tests and security validation."
```

## 📈 Measuring Success

Track these metrics to see the impact:

- **Coverage Increase**: Before vs. after using structured approach
- **Test Quality**: Number of bugs caught before production
- **Development Speed**: Time from requirement to tested feature
- **Team Confidence**: Subjective assessment of release confidence

## 🎮 Try It Right Now!

Pick any feature you're currently working on and run through this 10-minute workflow. You'll be amazed at how much comprehensive testing guidance you can generate in such a short time!

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Issues with prompts?** Check the examples directory for working examples
- **Framework not covered?** Adapt the templates to your specific tools
- **Want to contribute?** Open a PR with your improvements and examples

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basic workflow:

1. **Explore Advanced Features**: Try performance testing, security testing, accessibility workflows
2. **Customize for Your Team**: Modify workflows to match your team's standards and practices  
3. **Build Integration**: Integrate test generation into your development workflow
4. **Share and Iterate**: Share successful patterns with your team and refine based on feedback

The goal is to make comprehensive testing as easy as having a conversation with your AI assistant. Start simple, then gradually incorporate more sophisticated testing approaches as you get comfortable with the workflow.

Happy testing! 🧪✨
