## üìù Contribution Types

### Adding New Workflow Files
When creating new workflow markdown files:

1. **Follow the established pattern**:
   ```markdown
   # Workflow Title
   
   You are a [Role] who specializes in [Expertise]. Your task is to [Objective].
   
   ## Analysis Framework
   [How to analyze the input]
   
   ## Implementation Structure
   [Step-by-step approach]
   
   ## Code Examples
   [Concrete examples]
   
   ## Usage Instructions
   [How to use this workflow]
   ```

2. **Include comprehensive examples**
3. **Provide clear usage instructions**
4. **Test your workflow before submitting**

### Adding Examples
For new examples in the `/examples` directory:

1. **Use realistic scenarios** that developers commonly encounter
2. **Show complete workflows** from start to finish
3. **Include multiple tech stacks** when relevant
4. **Demonstrate best practices** in your examples

### Adding Templates
For new templates in the `/templates` directory:

1. **Create reusable patterns** that work across different contexts
2. **Include placeholder instructions** showing how to customize
3. **Provide usage examples** for each template
4. **Follow established naming conventions**

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Markdown Formatting
- Use clear, descriptive headers
- Include code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use tables for structured data
- Add emojis sparingly for visual appeal
- Keep line lengths reasonable (under 120 characters)

### Code Examples
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear, commented, complete examples
describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should validate email format', async () => {
    // Arrange: Set up test data
    const invalidEmail = 'not-an-email';
    
    // Act: Perform the action
    const result = validateEmail(invalidEmail);
    
    // Assert: Verify the outcome
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toContain('Invalid email format');
  });
});

// ‚ùå Avoid: Incomplete or unclear examples
it('test email', () => {
  expect(validateEmail('bad')).toBe(false);
});
```

### AI Prompt Guidelines
- **Be specific** about the role and expertise
- **Provide clear context** for analysis
- **Include structured output requirements**
- **Give concrete examples** of expected results
- **Add usage instructions** for the prompt
